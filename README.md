First lab experiment from my third year undergraduate in Physics at The University of Manchester.

* Brownian Motion.ipynb contains my simulation for brownian motion. This was done to overcome limitations of the experiment such as only being able to record motion in 2 dimensions. It is worth noting that this went significantly beyond what was expected by the lab script.
* Laser Tweezers Lab Notebook.pdf contains my handwritten notes from during the experiment including schematic diagrams, key figures, snippets of the recorded data, calculations, data analysis and conclusions.
* Lazer Tweezers Lab Script.pdf contains a breif outline of the experiment given to me before I started.
* Lazer Tweezers Lab Report.pdf contains my official lab report for the experiment, this explains the experiment and theory in academic format
* currentpower.py and kappa vs power.py contain basic python code to plot 2 dimensional plots for the lab notebook and script
